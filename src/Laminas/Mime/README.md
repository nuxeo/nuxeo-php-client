Luminas/Mime 2.7.x only gets security fixes, and 2.8.x and more recent requires PHP 7.3+.

To avoid a system upgrade, Luminas/Mime 2.7.x is embedded here in order to fix 
[PHPCLIENT-24](https://jira.nuxeo.com/browse/PHPCLIENT-24) which relates to [laminas-mime#26](https://github.com/laminas/laminas-mime/pull/26).

Please consider upgrading to the next minor version of the PHP client ASAP.
